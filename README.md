[Khovanov Homology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khovanov_homology) is a powerful knot invariant, capable (among other things) of [detecting the unknot](http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4346). For an *excellent* overview, see [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0201043) by Dror Bar-Natan (with lots of pretty pictures!)

This program will be based on the [tangle framework](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0410495v2.pdf) developed by Bar-Natan, and using the algorithms from [Fast Khovanov Homology Computations](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0606318v1.pdf) (also by Bar-Natan). 

The first version of the program will focus on creating the necessary data structures and computing the [Jones polynomial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_polynomial), which is the Euler characteristic for Khovanov homology. Once this is done, the full homology will be implemented.
